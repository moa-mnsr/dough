multiple ways of doing endings

endings as spectacle
endings as careful cuts

the dawn of endcare
critical work on temporality

LIVING IN THE WAKE
[collapse has already happened for many]
what does it mean to care with in the end times

INCARCERATION
(no progress out of it)

live with and make endings
how we embody

& it shapes time

//

how do we tell stories from endings

OBSOLECENCE AND AGING AS INTERSECTING
a pace of change that we have lived
through performed as a kind of structural

amnesia -- signifies for own 
memory -- generational knowledge
we don't exchange -- AGING
SOFTWARE -- pathologization
of the old & the past memes
by developers of paintings
FEMINIZING, AGIST
PATH TO ARRIVE TO SATURN
REQUIUM FOR THE SPACE CRAFT
"Grand finale not quite what I
hoped" we would have put
on thrusters again and again
before we let it go --
engineering idea of no waste
@ actual event they acted
like they knew how long fuel would
last but they didn't

ENDING AS CAREFUL CUTS
"managing software decay"
UNDOCUMENTED SOFTWARE THAT
HAD BEEN HOMEGROWN [CAN LIVE
WITHOUT] Infrastructrual Decay
Entangled Lifestyles
people w/ careers
leaving w/ knowledge

ENDING AS NEGOTIATING LOSS
-- dealing with decay
& degradation }}}

Here's a cake so you
don't say we don't give
you anything, scientists

live by flybys & orbits & 
engineers count days since
launch. 

people who made uptodate
software [NYT...]
because hardware can't be
changed all the time

if relied upon MAELSTROM
Endings as

Who is bound
to which obsolete
trajectories
TERMINAL PATTERNS
multiple ways of doing
endings ++++++++++++++

From Untimely to Convival Endings
"Dino or Well-Oiled Machine"
when is a timely end?

WHAT IS A GOOD ENDING

outer
space
part of
idea of
future
(also yucky
eugenics)

"method is the only currency
you hear about"

very dear very little computational 
storage -- might be relevant

strangler fig? thrives upon 
old code that strangles it

DRAIN ENDINGS

The conference was about false
futures, good endings
(theory x2) and then collective
solutions (support structures)
playful many-cultural collaborations
-- even fast-flying print!
